## 🏗️ Technical Details

### Changes from Original WAHA Core

1. **Version Detection Override** (`src/version.ts`)
   - `getWAHAVersion()` always returns `WAHAVersion.PLUS`
   - No more folder or environment variable checks

2. **Multi-Session Architecture** (`src/core/manager.core.ts`)
   - Replaced single session storage with `Map<string, WhatsappSession>`
   - Removed `OnlyDefaultSessionIsAllowed` exception
   - Removed `onlyDefault()` validation method
   - All session methods now support multiple concurrent sessions

3. **Plus Module** (`src/plus/app.module.plus.ts`)
   - Created Plus module that re-exports Core module
   - System detects PLUS version due to `/plus` folder existence

4. **Storage Management**
   - Disabled automatic storage cleanup on boot
   - Session configs are preserved across restarts
   - Each session has isolated storage
